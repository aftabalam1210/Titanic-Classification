# Titanic-Classification



This repository contains code and data for predicting the survival status of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset, available on Kaggle.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of two CSV files:

train.csv: This file contains the training data that will be used to build and train our predictive model. It includes information on various passengers, such as their age, gender, passenger class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare paid, and most importantly, whether they survived or not (the target variable).

test.csv: This file contains the test data on which we will apply our trained model to make predictions. It contains the same features as the training data but lacks the "Survived" column, which needs to be predicted.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a given passenger survived or not based on the available features. We will use various machine learning algorithms and techniques to accomplish this task.

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:
