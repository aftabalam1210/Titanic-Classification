# Titanic-Classification
This repository contains code and data for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that has proven effective in capturing sequential patterns, making it suitable for time-series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data for a particular company or stock index. It includes daily or hourly records of stock prices along with various other features like volume, moving averages, and technical indicators.

The dataset is divided into two parts:

train.csv: This file contains the historical stock price data that will be used to train the LSTM model. It includes the stock prices over a specific time period, usually the past few years.

test.csv: This file contains more recent stock price data for the same company or stock index. It is used to evaluate the performance of the trained LSTM model and assess how well it predicts future stock prices.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an LSTM model that can accurately predict future stock prices based on the historical stock price data and other relevant features.

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)
pandas
numpy
tensorflow (or tensorflow-gpu for GPU acceleration)
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Prediction-LSTM.git
cd Stock-Prediction-LSTM
Install the required dependencies using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the dataset:

Ensure you have the historical stock price data in train.csv and the more recent data in test.csv. Adjust the file names accordingly if needed.
Explore the dataset, train the LSTM model, and make predictions by running the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Stock_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.
